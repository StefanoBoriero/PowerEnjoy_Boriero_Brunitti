\subsection{External Inquiries}
The definition of external inquiry is a data request performed by a user. We divide have two different type of users, customers and employees. For the first we have the following possible inquiries:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get personal information
\item Get available vehicles from a given position
\end{itemize}
For the second we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get Safe areas
\item Get assistance list
\end{itemize}
Getting the available vehicles requires a bit of computation regarding vehicles position, so it will be labeled with an Average complexity. All the other interactions can be accomplished by a single query each, so they're classified with a Low complexity. A brief recap shown in the following table:\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{3cm}|p{2cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{External Inquiry} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{FP}\\
\hline
Get personal information & Low & 3\\
Get available vehicles & Average & 4\\
Get safe areas & Low & 3\\
Get assistance list & Low & 3\\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Total}} & 13\\
