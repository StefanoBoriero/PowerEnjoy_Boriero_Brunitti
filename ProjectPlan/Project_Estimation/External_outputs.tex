\subsection{External Outputs}
The system need also to communicate with users other information than results of inquiries. These operations go under the name of External Outputs, and occurr on these occations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Notify a user he's a Debtor
\item Notify a user he's been Banned
\item Notify a user he committed an Infraction
\item Notify a user his payment outcome
\item Notify an employee a car has been added to assistance list
\end{itemize}
Since the Notification Gateway our system is going to use is an external one, all these operations have a low complexity in our development process.
