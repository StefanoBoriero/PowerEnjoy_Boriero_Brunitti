\subsection{Overall Estimation}
A recap of everything we have stated about the complexity of our system is provided by this table\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{External Outputs} & \textbf{FP} \\
\hline

Internal Logic File & 69\\
External Logic File & 17\\
External Inputs & 48\\
External Inquiries & 13\\
External Outputs & 20\\
\hline
\textbf{Total} & 167\\

Considering Java Enterprise Edition as a development platform and disregarding the aspects concerning the implementation of the mobile applications (which can be thought as pure presentation with no business logic), we can estimate the total number of lines of code. Depending on the conversion rate, we have a lower bound of: \\
$ SLOC = 167 * 46 = 7 682$\\
and an upper bound of:\\
$ SLOC = 167 * 67 = 11 189$\\
