\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Platform Volatility}:\\
We don't expect major changes to happen often, as the additional functionalities for such an application are limited; plus, as we don't plan on providing a dedicated app, even client side won't need much changes to remain up to date. For these reasons, the Rating Level is set to Low
