We will follow a functional grouping approach, grouping components in the submodules presented above. We will first integrate functional groups of Employee subsystem, as these exploited also by the other subsystems. Then we will proceed integrating functional groups of Car subsystem and Customer subsystem.
\\

For each functional group we will follow a bottom-up approach, and once integrated all submodules of a subsystem, we will integrate the subsystem with its dispatcher and web application. This will allow us to focus initially on binary integrations and to start testing complete functionalities as we proceed.
