We will follow a functional grouping approach, grouping components in the submodules presented above. We will first integrate functional groups of Customer subsystem, as these are the most critical, then we will proceed integrating functional groups of Employee subsystem and Car subsystem.
\\

For each functional group we will follow a bottom-up approach, and once integrated all submodules of a subsystem, we will integrate the subsystem with its dispatcher and web application. This will allow us to focus initially on binary integrations and to start testing complete functionalities as we proceed.
