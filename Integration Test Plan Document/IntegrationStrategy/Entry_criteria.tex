Before starting the integration phase, we have to meet certain constraints on different aspects of the project.
\\\\
All components must have been unit tested
The integration procedure should start after these percentages of completion are reached:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{100\%} of DatabaseController functionalities
\item At least \textbf{90\%} of Customer subsystem
\item At least \textbf{80\%} of Car subsystem
\item At least \textbf{50\%} of Employee subsystem
\end{itemize}
