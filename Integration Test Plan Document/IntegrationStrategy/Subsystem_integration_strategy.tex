To integrate the tested subsystem, we start from integrating the Customer subsystem with the Employee Subsystem

\end{figure}

Then we proceed integrating the Customer subsystem with the car subsystem

\end{figure}

And the other way around

\end{figure}

To end the process, we integrate the Car subsystem with the employee subsystem

This is the final integrated system
